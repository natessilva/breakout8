## Design

A simple breakout game.

To start, 3 lives, 1 ball, 1 paddle, multiple bricks. Press x/o to launch, ball smashes brick.

If the ball touches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a life.

Bricks might take multiple hits to break. There might be multiple varieties of bricks.

Smashing all bricks advances player to more difficult levels

The game might have powerups drop from stronger bricks when they are desroyed.

## Problems to solve

- Ball movement
- Paddle movement
- Paddle collision (when the ball hits the paddle)
- Lives and game end state
- Bricks and collisions with bricks
- Brick erosion/death - bricks die after so many hits
- Multiple flavors of brick
- level designs
- power-ups (there could be lots of these)

## Fun mechanic ideas

- Mario style screen wrap for the paddle

### Power-ups

- multi-ball
- sticky paddle
- longer paddle
- ball-bombs

### Ani-power-ups

- shrinking paddle
- fast-ball
- re-appearing bricks
